# Ascendancy System

Ascendancies are powerful sub-class specializations that dramatically change how your heroes play. Each class has access to 2-3 unique ascendancy paths, offering distinct playstyles and strategic options.

## Unlocking Ascendancies

Heroes unlock their ascendancy through Ascendancy Trials:

| Level | Event |
|-------|-------|
| 25 | First Ascendancy Trial - Choose your path |
| 50 | Second Trial - Gain second point |
| 75 | Third Trial - Gain third point |
| 100 | Fourth Trial - Gain fourth point |

### Ascendancy Points

Each ascendancy has **10 nodes** in a branching tree:
- 1 Starting node (defines the path)
- 3 Branches (A, B, C) with 3 nodes each

You earn **4 points total** (one per trial), so you'll choose 4 of 10 nodes. This creates meaningful build diversity.

### Build Tips

1. **Focus one branch** - Going deep (3 nodes) in one branch is usually stronger than spreading out
2. **Starting node matters** - Some ascendancies change core abilities (Berserker removes Taunt)
3. **Synergy with gear** - Choose ascendancies that match your equipment plan
4. **Party composition** - Consider what roles your party needs covered
5. **Respec is limited** - Choose carefully; changing ascendancy is expensive
