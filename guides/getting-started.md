# Getting Started with Hero's Guild

Welcome to Hero's Guild! This guide will help you get started on your journey to build the greatest guild in the realm.

## First Launch

When you start Hero's Guild for the first time, you'll be greeted with the main menu. Select **New Game** to begin your adventure.

### Choosing Your Starting Heroes

You'll begin with a small amount of gold and the ability to recruit your first heroes. Visit the **Tavern** to see available heroes for hire. Consider recruiting:

- **A tank** (Warrior or Cleric) - To absorb damage and protect your team
- **A damage dealer** (Mage, Rogue, or Ranger) - To eliminate enemies quickly
- **A healer** (Cleric) - To keep your party alive

Starting with 2-3 heroes is recommended. You can always recruit more as you earn gold.

## The Guild Screen

The Guild Screen is your home base. Here you can:

- **View your heroes** - See all recruited heroes, their stats, and equipment
- **Manage facilities** - Build and upgrade guild buildings
- **Access the tavern** - Recruit new heroes
- **Check the mission board** - Find dungeons to explore
- **Open the shop** - Buy and sell items

### Key Facilities

As you progress, unlock these essential facilities:

| Facility | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Barracks | Increases hero capacity |
| Training Grounds | Heroes gain passive XP |
| Blacksmith | Craft weapons and armor |
| Alchemist | Brew potions and elixirs |
| Enchanter | Add magical properties to items |

## Your First Dungeon

Ready for adventure? Head to the **Mission Board** and select a low-difficulty dungeon (1-2 stars).

### Selecting Your Party

- Choose 3-4 heroes for your expedition
- Balance your team with tank, damage, and support roles
- Check that heroes are healthy (not injured or exhausted)

### Dungeon Exploration

Dungeons consist of multiple rooms connected by corridors. Each room may contain:

- **Enemies** - Combat encounters
- **Treasure** - Loot chests with items and gold
- **Events** - Random encounters that may help or hinder
- **Shops** - Merchants selling supplies
- **Boss** - Powerful enemies with better rewards

### Combat Basics

Combat is turn-based with these key mechanics:

1. **Initiative** - Determines turn order (higher is faster)
2. **Attack** - Use basic attacks or skills to damage enemies
3. **Defend** - Reduce incoming damage
4. **Skills** - Powerful abilities with various effects

Target weaker enemies first, use your tank to draw aggro (threat), and keep your healer ready.

## After the Dungeon

Upon returning to the guild:

1. **Collect rewards** - Gold, items, and experience
2. **Heal injuries** - Injured heroes need rest or medical attention
3. **Manage mood** - Exhausted heroes may need a break
4. **Equip new gear** - Upgrade your heroes with found equipment
5. **Sell extras** - Vendor unwanted items for gold

## Progression Tips

### Early Game (Levels 1-20)

- Focus on one strong party rather than many weak heroes
- Complete easy dungeons repeatedly to build resources
- Upgrade your Blacksmith for better gear
- Save gold for emergency situations (wages, healing)

### Building Your Guild

- Hire diverse hero classes for flexibility
- Build relationships between heroes (they fight better together)
- Invest in crafting facilities for better equipment
- Keep backup heroes in case of injuries

### Managing Resources

- **Gold** - Pay weekly wages, buy items, construct buildings
- **Materials** - Craft equipment and consumables
- **Hero Mood** - Keep heroes happy for better performance

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overextending** - Don't tackle dungeons beyond your level
2. **Ignoring injuries** - Injured heroes perform poorly and may die
3. **No reserves** - Always have backup heroes ready
4. **Hoarding gold** - Invest in facilities and equipment
5. **Neglecting relationships** - Heroes with bonds fight better together
