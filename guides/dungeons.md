## Difficulty System

Dungeons have two independent difficulty factors:

### Stars (Complexity)

Stars determine dungeon length and structure:

| Stars | Rooms | Floors | Duration | Boss? |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| ⭐ | 4 | 1 | 1 day | No |
| ⭐⭐ | 7 | 1 | 2 days | No |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | 12 | 2 | 3 days | Yes |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 16 | 3 | 4 days | Yes |
| ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | 20 | 4 | 5 days | Yes |

### Monster Level (Power)

Monster level determines enemy strength:
- Higher level = more HP, more damage
- Scales with your guild's highest hero level
- Independent of star rating

**Example Combinations:**
- ⭐ + Level 50: Quick farm run for high-level heroes
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ + Level 10: Epic challenge for new heroes

### Reward Scaling

| Stars | Gold | XP | Elite Chance |
|-------|------|-----|--------------|
| ⭐ | 1.0x | 1.0x | 0% |
| ⭐⭐ | 1.5x | 1.5x | 10% |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | 2.0x | 2.0x | 20% |
